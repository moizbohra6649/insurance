                          case you get into a vehicular accident.</p>
                        <p>Many Americans spend a big part of their days on the road, which alone raises the probability
                          of incidents occurring. Add to that the existence of various factors, such as extreme weather
                          conditions, drunk or reckless drivers, car failures — and you’re practically always in peril.
                        </p>
                        <p>That’s where auto insurance comes in. You only have to pay your insurance provider a little
                          bit every month, and they, in turn, give you financial coverage if you get into an emergency.

                        <p>Just like any other type of insurance, getting auto insurance means regularly paying small
                          amounts to your insurance provider. In return, if you ever get into an incident that qualifies
                          under your coverage, the provider shoulders most, if not all, of the financial burden.
                        </p>
                        <p>Nowadays, there’s an abundance of insurance products in the market, so it could be difficult
                          to navigate between all of their complex differences.</p>
                        <p>Remember, the cost of your monthly premiums will depend on your insurance provider and your
                          specific coverage. Similarly, qualified incidents and benefits are based on that, as well.
                          That’s why it’s very important to do your due diligence when choosing your provider.

                          getting the best car insurance for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>Regular maintenance and repairs: Insurance companies are not responsible for your car’s
                          regular maintenance and repair expenses.
                        </p>
                        <p>Ridesharing industry: If you drive for ridesharing companies such as Lyft or Uber, you’re
                          going to need a separate policy from the traditional car insurance.
                        </p>
                        <p>Individuals not in your policy: If a person other than you is driving your car during the
                          accident in question, that person normally wouldn’t be covered by your insurance. </p>
                        <p>However, make sure to check your specific policy, as some allow special permissions for
                          such cases. For instance, there are policies that allow friends and family, including your
                          teenage children, as you live in one place.</p>
                        <p>Very high-value cars: Cars with a very high market price, like exotic, sports, or performance
                          vehicles, are typically not covered by regular car insurance. You’ll need another kind of
                          policy specific for high-value cars.
                        </p>
                        <p>Personal belongings: Anything else other than the car itself won’t be covered by car
                          insurance. For example, if a thief broke your window and stole personal belongings inside
                          your vehicle, the car window will usually be covered, but not what was stolen.
                          Now that we know what auto insurance doesn’t cover, it’s much easier to discuss what they
                          do cover, especially in case you get into a car accident.
                        </p>
                        <p>Specific car insurance coverage is often subdivided into particular insurance products that
                          become part of your premium. However, it can be generally divided into three </p>
                        <p><b>Liability:</b> Liability refers to any damage that you might cause while you’re driving
                          your insured car. This type of coverage can include damage to property, damage to another
                          vehicle, or injury to another person.</p>
                        <p><b>Personal injury:</b> You can get compensated for any lost wages or medical bills that
                          resulted from your accident. Depending on your policy, this can also include other people
                          as long as they’re in the contract.</p>
                        <p><b>Collision:</b> If your car was damaged due to collision events, such as vehicular
                          accidents, damage from man-made structures, or clashes with other obstacles, collision
                          coverage would help you pay for repair or replacement.</p>
                        <p>These categories are further subdivided into specific insurance products, which we will
                          discuss in the next section.
